# Diffraction

This project was made for a course during a third year of my studies. It's a webpage using multiple new things added in HTML5, with it's content being controlled by JavaScript and a program simulating diffraction of visible spectrum light and displaying it's image on a "screen" shown on the simulation, also using JavaScript. There are two versions of simulation, with one or two fissures. Adding a second fissure changes the results dramaticly due to interference of electromagnetic waves. Specific information is included in the webpage contents.
